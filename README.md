# Monopoly Game in Excel with VBA
For this project, I created my own version of Monopoly using Excel with VBA for enhanced interactivity. The game, named "Outlet City", features custom properties, brands, and player dashboards. Here's a quick overview:

Custom Board Design: The board is designed with popular brands like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and McDonald's. Players can land on various properties, purchase them, and pay rent as in the traditional Monopoly game.
Player Dashboard: Each player has a dashboard that tracks their money, current position, and owned properties. The dashboard also features interactive buttons for rolling dice, adjusting positions, and managing money transactions.
Custom Prices: Each brand has a unique purchase and family price, adding a fun twist to the traditional Monopoly gameplay.
VBA Integration: The game mechanics, such as moving pieces, handling transactions, and rolling dice, are powered by VBA, which allows for automation and seamless user interaction.
This project demonstrates how Excel and VBA can be used creatively to build a fully interactive game experience. If you'd like, I can provide more details on how the VBA code works or explain specific parts of the interface!
